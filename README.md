# Interesting Simulations

A collection of interesting mathematical and scientific simulations implemented in Python.

## Simulations

### 1. Longest Run of Heads
Simulates coin flips and calculates the probability distribution of the longest run of consecutive heads. Uses parallel processing for efficient computation.

#### Requirements
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- tqdm

#### Usage
```bash
python simulations/coin_flip_runs.py
```
